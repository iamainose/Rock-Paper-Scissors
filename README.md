# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Javascript & Javascript DOM is so fucking hard but i did it through practice, Only took me 20 hours to complete which includes the HTML and CSS too(laughs).

Learning how to create the game has improved my problem solving skills and how callback functions and parameters work and where to watch out for errors in future projects, Anyways enjoy the game.
